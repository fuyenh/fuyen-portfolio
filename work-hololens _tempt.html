                <p>
                    Music Everywhere started as a graduate school project during my time at Carnegie Mellon University. Our team consisted of two programmers, one musician and one designer—me. 
                    Our goal: build an Augmented Reality (AR) piano learning tool.

                <p>
                    After graduating, our success with this academic project soon inspired us to spin off into a startup to continue using AR for music learning. In April 2017, we formed our company <cite>Music Everywhere, Inc.</cite>, and by December of 2017 we had entered, submitted and won first place in the Microsoft and Unity sponsored AR HoloLens competition. Along with the grand prize of $100K, 
                    we expanded and published our app to the Microsoft Store.

                <h1 class="header__work">Streamline piano learning experience</h1>                                
                <p>
                    Most piano learning apps are designed for mobile phones and tablets. A major issue for users during play comes 
                    when users must mentally translate the instructions from the screen to the physical instrument. This seemed ripe for improvement using AR. 
                </p>

                <h1 class="header__work--up orange">The Approach</h1>
                <h1 class="header__work">Augmented Reality</h1> 
                <p>
                    With AR technology, we align the 3D interface (the piano instructions) directly on the physical piano keys. This makes discerning our AR  
                    instructions with the actual instrument easier and more intuitive.

                    <p>
                        In order to determine which note users played on the keyboard, we used a Bluetooth
                        connection to send out a MIDI signal from the digital piano to the HoloLens. This made ensuring a good connection critical to the experience.

                    <p>
                         Due to the native HoloLens environment, users must pair Bluetooth devices through the device’s system settings. To help guide users, I created an animation to 
                         teach them how to complete this process, and included a tutorial for the Bluetooth connection process 
                         troubleshooting as well, in case the original setup was not done correctly.

                        The system can detect the piano size after users press the first and the last key, and adapts the AR interface to the keys.

                        our team was always on hand to help assist users in tech setup and user calibration - 
                        we often relied on instinct, which (let’s face it) is a truly mysterious endeavor.

                        Our goal is to guide and inspire people on how they can express themselves with playing piano, through improvisation. 
                        In our lessons, the virtual musicians teach improv knowledge. Users can follow along with instructions in Following Mode, or experiment with different notes in Improv Mode.
                        It’s not about learning to play perfectly, it’s more about learning the value of jumping right into playing music.

                    <p>
                        Our first version enabled user to pick lessons according to genre, which posed some problems when we tried to expand the lesson content later. 
                        The problem we faced in this structure was the difficulty in making it modular and scalable. 
                        We knew we needed to redesign it.

                        We designed the lesson packages which included several lessons within them. 
                        This allowed us to design a system that accounted for every music level, to define each lesson package’s level, and to upload more materials for the future.

                    <p>
                        AR experiences often tend to be unstable due to technical limitations today. 
                        For example,  the AR interface might drift away from the current alignment or the Bluetooth connection might disappear. 
                        Relaunching the app was annoying, but during the period we developed this at school, it was a simple fix for many bugs. When we were building our next version to publish, we knew it was critical to craft troubleshooting functions for users within the app. 
                    </p>
                    <!-- <h1 class="header__work--sub">Solution - Troubleshooting function</h1> -->
                    <p>
                        To reach the goal, I designed the torubleshoot process. When problems happen, users can pause the experience in place to resolve the issue.

                    <p>
                       People love animated characters. They’re fun, liven up a scene, and provide a fun way to instill the context of music playing with a band. 
                       To achieve this in a meaningful way, I built up more animations to sync with music beats and created more interaction scenarios.

                        I optimized all the 3D topology which allowed me to create more complicated animations.
                        With these changes, the animated virtual musician step towards the user to teach them how to play, and react to the music rhythm beat by beat. This captures the user’s attention in a playful way.

                    Considering the worst cases, I design the “No-Piano Demo”option for people who can’t get the settings to work, or without a proper piano. Through this demo, people can get a preliminary understanding for how Music Everywhere works.                     
                    From this pessimistic perspective, we developed a full FAQ section. Here, users could troubleshoot by themselves with guided instructions, and get to know more details about Music Everywhere.<br>
                    Developing for the HoloLens, we’ve encountered many surprises. Between navigating the foundation UX of AR, integrating with other hardware, 
                    working around a limited FOV, experience stability is not guaranteed. Thinking pessimistically drove us to discover some fundamental problems 
                    we ignored earlier in our process, led us to optimize more playing conditions.

                    Working on the Microsoft HoloLens platform allowed us to be an early publisher of AR music learning content. We got early recognition from industry leaders, but knew that our future would depend on Mobile AR. The HoloLens, though an established platform, is too expensive to ever achieve widespread adoption ($3K USD).
