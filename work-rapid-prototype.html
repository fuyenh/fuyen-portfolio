                <p>
                    The goal of this project was to define, design, develop and execute a live game experience for the June 2016 G4C Festival in New York City. We were tasked with defining the design and physical elements of a live game  to run during the Festival.
                    The game needed to consider the following criteria:

                    On a high level, we sought to create an experience that empowered 
                    people with understanding and empathy of others' beliefs. We wanted to 
                    leverage this to cultivate meaningful conversation around the issue 
                    of Gun Violence in the U.S

                    In this live experience, an audience controls a conversation that is happening on stage between 
                    two actors with opposing gun control view points. By keying in questions on a custom made 
                    web application, the audience controls what one of the actors says to the other, guiding the 
                    dialogue to a conclusion.

                    In order to deliver our project to the G4C festival, 
                    we promoted the game, installed it in the space, and gave gameplay 
                    instructions during the showcase itself. To help our audience 
                    understand the gameplay, we used a detailed visualisation of how the 
                    actions and processes between the audience and the game affected the experience.

                <p>
                    We designed this theater game with the aim of transforming our audience 
                    beyond their experience playing. Impacting players' emotions as they directed 
                    the actors onstage served as our emotional goal, all while we tried to build up 
                    their understanding and mastery of the specific mechanics of the performance.

                    During the ideation phase, we tried to identify what are the cirticle

                </p>

                    We decided to focuse on themes of bad driving habits and using <b>Guilt</b> as

                <p>
                    To design this narrative VR experience, I started with analyzing user's engagement during                           
                    different story stages, then illustrated more detailed experience with storyboards and animations.

                    I staged the high level story structure by analyzing user's emotion and engagement through the story progression
                    in the VR space. In this way, the team had a clear roadmap to develop the experience.

                    The storyboards helped the team so identify the visual elements in the time frame.

                    Last, with the design framework I built, I was able to create the detailed interaction flow for the final implement.

                    In Hindsight, we have seen that it is possible to make a choice based experience that 
                    merges 360 live-action footage with CG objects, and can see where it can be improved. 
                    Having an actor look you directly in the eyes and having your brain tell you they are next 
                    to you is a truly powerful interaction. Blending that with an experience that is highly 
                    interactive and blurs the boundary of the cinema and CG will spawn some fascinating and 
                    likely moving experiences.
