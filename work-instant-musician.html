                <p>
                    Instant Musician is an iOS app that guides people through playing music on the piano. 
                    It leverages ARKit, and is a sister product to our award-winning HoloLens app, Music Everywhere.
                     This product is the second AR music app from my startup <i>Music Everywhere, Inc</i> which consists of one 
                     programmer, one musician and one designer - me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After our success on the HoloLens platform with <a class="green" href="/work-hololens.html"><i>Music Everywhere</i></a>, we connected with many other AR hardware manufacturers in the 
                    hope that we’d land on a platform that could reach a larger user base; in other words, something that was cheaper than the enterprise-focused
                     HoloLens. These companies included Magic Leap, Meta and Lenovo’s AR headset (launched with the lightsaber controller for Jedi Challenges).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, these products had tracking and visibility limitations that convinced us that AR head-mounted displays 
                    are not quite ready for the consumer market. One viable platform, however, remained: Apple’s iPhone.

                <p>
                    Learning how to play an instrument is really hard. You need a good teacher, you need to practice a lot, and you often need to spend a significant amount of money before any of that. And you have to stay committed to learning this instrument 
                    for a long time before you can start playing the songs you enjoy.                     
                </p>

                <p>
                    While playtesting Music Everywhere with the HoloLens, we observed a funny thing: <br>

                     Using Augmented Reality (AR), we let people bypass this tough music learning curve, 
                     and skip to fun part - playing songs!

                    We want to reach users who feel left behind from learning music due to limitations in conventional music education. Our AR solution presents a flexible approach and innovative technology that opens the door for new

                <p>
                    In order to determine which note users played on the keyboard, we used a Bluetooth
                    connection to send out a MIDI signal from the digital piano to the HoloLens. This made ensuring a good connection critical to the experience.

                <p>
                     Our first version was intended for the full 88 keyed piano (full size), but there are many products in 
                     the market that feature different sizes. How do we design an experience that works for the majority of these products?

                <p>
                    Calibration to ensure proper alignment gives the foundation for the entire experience. Without it, the instructions are useless. In our academic project, our team was always on hand to help assist users in tech setup and user calibration - we often relied on instinct, which (let’s face it) is a truly mysterious endeavor. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a shipped product, we knew we needed to create an intuitive process for users to do this themselves, successfully and reliably.

                         Due to the native HoloLens environment, users must pair Bluetooth devices through the device’s system settings. To help guide users, I created an animation to 
                         teach them how to complete this process, and included a tutorial for the Bluetooth connection process 
                         troubleshooting as well, in case the original setup was not done correctly.

                        We cover 88, 61 , 49 and 25 keys of size of pianos, which accounts for almost every kind. 
                        The system can detect the piano size after users press the first and the last key, and adapts the AR interface to the keys.

                        A customized image tracking marker is within hand’s reach for the user to spawn the AR interface. 
                        By looking at the tracking marker, users can spawn the interface. 
                        Then place it on the middle C to adjust the alignment by easily moving the markers around.

                        Our first version enabled user to pick lessons according to genre, which posed some problems when we tried to expand the lesson content later. 
                        The problem we faced in this structure was the difficulty in making it modular and scalable. 
                        We knew we needed to redesign it.

                    <p>
                        AR experiences often tend to be unstable due to technical limitations today. 
                        For example,  the AR interface might drift away from the current alignment or the Bluetooth connection might disappear. 
                        Relaunching the app was annoying, but during the period we developed this at school, it was a simple fix for many bugs. When we were building our next version to publish, we knew it was critical to craft troubleshooting functions for users within the app.

                    People love animated characters. They’re fun, liven up a scene, and provide a fun way to instill the context of music playing with a band. 
                    To achieve this in a meaningful way, I built up more animations to sync with music beats and created more interaction scenarios.

                 <p>
                    Working on the Microsoft HoloLens platform allowed us to be an early publisher of AR music learning content. We got early recognition from industry leaders, but knew that our future would depend on Mobile AR. The HoloLens, though an established platform, is too expensive to ever achieve widespread adoption ($3K USD).

                 <p>
                    Looking ahead, we knew we would make our next experience using ARKit for iOS, bringing our user base pool from early adopter AR enthusiasts to the population at large. Hello, iPhone.
