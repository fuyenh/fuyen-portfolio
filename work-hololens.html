                <p>
                    Music Everywhere started as a graduate school project during my time at Carnegie Mellon University. Our team consisted of two programmers, one musician and one designer—me. 
                    Our goal: build an Augmented Reality (AR) piano learning tool.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After graduating, our success with this academic project soon inspired us to spin off into a startup to continue using AR for music learning. In April 2017, we formed our company <cite>Music Everywhere, Inc.</cite>, and by December of 2017 we had entered, submitted and won first place in the Microsoft and Unity sponsored AR HoloLens competition. Along with the grand prize of $100K, 
                    we expanded and published our app to the Microsoft Store.

                </p>
                <p>
                    During the initial months of our startup’s life, we focused on developing a more polished AR experience, with 
                    the aim to publish it to the store and enter it into the HoloLens competition.

                <h1 class="header__work--sub">Problem and Opportunity</h1>  
                <p>
                    Most piano learning apps are designed for mobile phones and tablets. A major issue for users during play comes 
                    when users must mentally translate the instructions from the screen to the physical instrument. This seemed ripe for improvement using AR. 
                </p>         
    
                <h1 class="header__work--sub">Solution</h1> 
                <p>
                    With AR technology, we align the 3D interface (the piano instructions) directly on the physical piano keys. This makes discerning our AR  
                    instructions with the actual instrument easier and more intuitive. 
                    <br><a class="orange" href="http://homes.create.aau.dk/dano/nime17/papers/0104/paper0104.pdf" target="blank">To read more about the AR Interface Design, please see this NIME2017 paper we published.</a>

                    We want to reach users who feel left behind from learning music due to limitations in conventional music education. Our AR solution presents a flexible approach and innovative technology that opens the door for new 
                    students to discover real musical experiences that can enrich their lives.

                <p>
                    In order to determine which note users played on the keyboard, we used a Bluetooth
                    connection to send out a MIDI signal from the digital piano to the HoloLens. This made ensuring a good connection critical to the experience.     
                </p>

                <h1 class="header__work--sub">Challenge 2 - Account for different piano keyboard sizes</h1>
                <p>
                     Our first version was intended for the full 88 keyed piano (full size), but there are many products in 
                     the market that feature different sizes. How do we design an experience that works for the majority of these products?

                <h1 class="header__work--sub">Challenge 3 - Guiding users to setup keyboard alignment</h1>
                <p>
                    Calibration to ensure proper alignment gives the foundation for the entire experience. Without it, the instructions are useless. In our academic project, our team was always on hand to help assist users in tech setup and user calibration - we often relied on instinct, which (let’s face it) is a truly mysterious endeavor. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a shipped product, we knew we needed to create an intuitive process for users to do this themselves, successfully and reliably.

                    <p>
                         Due to the native HoloLens environment, users must pair Bluetooth devices through the device’s system settings. To help guide users, I created an animation to 
                         teach them how to complete this process, and included a tutorial for the Bluetooth connection process 
                         troubleshooting as well, in case the original setup was not done correctly.

                        We cover 88, 61 , 49 and 25 keys of size of pianos, which accounts for almost every kind. 
                        The system can detect the piano size after users press the first and the last key, and adapts the AR interface to the keys.

                        A customized image tracking marker is within hand’s reach for the user to spawn the AR interface. 
                        By looking at the tracking marker, users can spawn the interface. 
                        Then place it on the middle C to adjust the alignment by easily moving the markers around.

                        Our first version enabled user to pick lessons according to genre, which posed some problems when we tried to expand the lesson content later. 
                        The problem we faced in this structure was the difficulty in making it modular and scalable. 
                        We knew we needed to redesign it.

                    <p>
                        AR experiences often tend to be unstable due to technical limitations today. 
                        For example,  the AR interface might drift away from the current alignment or the Bluetooth connection might disappear. 
                        Relaunching the app was annoying, but during the period we developed this at school, it was a simple fix for many bugs. When we were building our next version to publish, we knew it was critical to craft troubleshooting functions for users within the app.

                 <h1 class="header__work--sub">Challenge 3 - AR character development & energizing the experience</h1>
                 <p>
                    People love animated characters. They’re fun, liven up a scene, and provide a fun way to instill the context of music playing with a band. 
                    To achieve this in a meaningful way, I built up more animations to sync with music beats and created more interaction scenarios.

                    With these changes, the animated virtual musician step towards the user to teach them how to play, and react to the music rhythm beat by beat. This captures the user’s attention in a playful way.

                 <p>
                    Working on the Microsoft HoloLens platform allowed us to be an early publisher of AR music learning content. We got early recognition from industry leaders, but knew that our future would depend on Mobile AR. The HoloLens, though an established platform, is too expensive to ever achieve widespread adoption ($3K USD). 
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    Looking ahead, we knew we would make our next experience using ARKit for iOS, bringing our user base pool from early adopter AR enthusiasts to the population at large. Hello, iPhone.
